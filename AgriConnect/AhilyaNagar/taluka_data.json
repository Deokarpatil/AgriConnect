        "Importance": "Akole is a hilly taluka in the Sahyadri range, receiving heavy rainfall (1500–3000 mm).",
        "Advantages": "Half of the area is forested, ensuring perennial streams. Soils range from lateritic on hills to deep black in valleys. Major crops include sugarcane, grapes, and pomegranates.",
        "Geography": "Mountainous terrain with undulating plateaus; Kalsubai peak (~646 m) is the highest point.",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Mainly from Bhandardara/Nilwande dams and mountain streams in the Pravara basin; wells and tube-wells also used.",
        "Challenges": "Steep slopes cause soil erosion and limit arable land; mechanization is difficult; agriculture is monsoon-dependent."
      },
      "Sangamner": {
        "Importance": "Located in the north Ahmednagar 'sugar belt'; one of the district's most productive talukas.",
        "Advantages": "Soils are medium-to-deep black; climate is subtropical with strong monsoon. Major crops include millet (bajra), cotton, soybean, and pomegranates.",
        "Geography": "Broad plains (~500 m elevation) around the confluence of Pravara and Mula rivers; gentle topography.",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Irrigated by river canals from Pravara and Mula dams; dense network of wells and borewells.",
        "Challenges": "Hot summers can cause water stress; soil salinity and waterlogging in some areas; market price fluctuations affect farmers."
      },
      "Kopargaon": {
        "Importance": "Situated on the fertile Godavari floodplain; key area for sugarcane and grape cultivation.",
        "Advantages": "Deep alluvial black soils with good moisture retention. Major crops are sugarcane, bananas, grapes, jawar, and pulses.",
        "Geography": "Flat riverine plains at ~500 m altitude with fertile silt; moderate rainfall (~600–700 mm).",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Heavily irrigated by Godavari River canals (Jayakwadi system), wells, and tube-wells; Pravara (Nathsagar) reservoir also contributes.",
        "Challenges": "Waterlogging and salinity in wet years; tight water allocation in droughts; dependence on few cash crops makes area sensitive to market swings."
      },
      "Rahata": {
        "Importance": "Located on the Godavari/Pravara plains; moderately productive taluka known for horticulture.",
        "Advantages": "Fertile black and alluvial soils; major crops include grapes, pomegranates, sugarcane, banana, and cotton.",
        "Geography": "Flat alluvial plains (~500 m) with hot, dry climate except during monsoon.",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Primarily Godavari canal system (Jayakwadi) and wells; some water lifted from Pravara streams fed by Bhandardara dams.",
        "Challenges": "High water demand for orchards stresses resources; limited irrigation in droughts can reduce yields; intensive cultivation can lead to soil erosion and declining fertility."
      },

        "Geography": "Fertile plains around 450–500 m elevation; Pravara river runs through the taluka.",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Godavari and Pravara canals, numerous wells; Nathsagar (Pravara) reservoir ensures year-round flow.",
        "Challenges": "Overreliance on sugarcane; maintenance of irrigation infrastructure; high water table and occasional flooding can cause drainage problems."
      },
      "Nevasa": {
        "Importance": "High-productivity taluka benefiting from the Godavari network; grows both staple and cash crops.",
        "Advantages": "Deep black alluvial soils with good moisture; major crops include sugarcane, wheat, cotton, and vegetables.",
        "Geography": "Broad plains around 500–550 m with some rocky uplands; hot-dry climate except during monsoon.",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Godavari/Pravara canals, extensive tube-wells; small tanks to the west.",
        "Challenges": "Water scarcity in late summer if canal flows are reduced; salinity from heavy irrigation; farming land partly diverted to tourism due to pilgrimage sites."
      },
      "Shevgaon": {
        "Importance": "One of the lowest-productivity talukas; predominantly dryland farming area.",
        "Advantages": "Medium to deep black soils on the plateau; major crops are rainfed sorghum (jawar), pulses, oilseeds, and fodder.",
        "Geography": "Flat to gently undulating Deccan plateau at ~600 m; semi-arid climate with low and erratic rainfall (~500–600 mm).",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Very limited—mostly shallow wells and tank irrigation; no major river or canal.",
        "Challenges": "Chronic water scarcity; soil degradation due to overuse; low yields; poor road connectivity limits market access."
      },
      "Pathardi": {
        "Importance": "Eastern taluka of moderate productivity; key cotton and grain-growing region.",
        "Advantages": "Soils vary from shallow black to red loam; major crops are cotton, maize, sorghum, and soybean.",
        "Geography": "Lies on the eastern Deccan plateau at ~700 m; hottest and driest part of Ahmednagar with ~500 mm rainfall.",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Mostly groundwater via tube-wells; some check-dams on seasonal streams; no large dams or canals.",
        "Challenges": "Very low rainfall leads to frequent droughts; soil salinity under irrigation; erratic monsoons and high input costs cause economic stress."
      },
      "Ahmednagar_Taluka": {

        "Advantages": "Mixed soils: black cotton soil in the south and red loams in the north; major crops are pulses, wheat, sunflower, and pearl millet.",
        "Geography": "Hilly and plateau regions around 650–700 m; Mula river irrigates the city area; mild winters and hot summers with ~600 mm rain.",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Mula Dam feeds canals; extensive wells; tanks in local uplands capture rain.",
        "Challenges": "Urbanization encroaches on farmland; falling water table; irrigation canals sometimes bring salinity; pollution from the city can affect farm water."
      },
      "Rahuri": {
        "Importance": "Headquarters of MPKV agricultural university; moderate-productivity taluka known for vegetable and spice production.",
        "Advantages": "Red and black soils; better-than-average rainfall (~700–800 mm); major crops include onion, grapes, sorghum, and cotton.",
        "Geography": "Plateau at ~550 m with gently rolling terrain; strong monsoons and dry, cool winters ideal for Rabi vegetables.",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Primarily tube-wells tapping groundwater; small dams on local streams; canals from Mula Dam; widespread use of drip irrigation.",
        "Challenges": "Onion price fluctuations affect incomes; waterlogging from over-irrigation; high pest and disease pressure in commercial vegetable cultivation."
      },
      "Parner": {
        "Importance": "Traditionally dry, hilly taluka with the lowest productivity; important for onion cultivation.",
        "Advantages": "Mainly red and shallow black soils on Arghyadale hills; major crops are Rabi onion, wheat, and millets.",
        "Geography": "Hilly forested terrain (~600–700 m) with poor, shallow soils; low and unpredictable rainfall (~500 mm).",
        "Irrigation_Sources": "Very scarce; farms rely on shallow wells and rainwater harvesting; almost no canal water.",
        "Challenges": "Severe water scarcity and drought; high soil erosion on slopes; poor transportation limits market access."
      },
        "Shrigonda": {
          "Importance": "Shrigonda taluka is in south-east Ahmednagar. It is known for dryland farming and famous for pomegranate and jawar crops.",
          "Advantages": "Black cotton soil is available in many parts, and it gives good results if rain is proper. Farmers grow pomegranate, jawar, bajra, gram (chana), and cotton. Some farmers also grow vegetables.",
          "Geography": "Area is mostly flat with some small hills. Average height is around 600 meters. Rainfall is low (around 500 to 600 mm), mostly during June to September.",
          "Irrigation_Sources": "No big rivers, but canals from Kukadi and Ghod project reach some parts. Many farmers depend on wells and borewells. Some use drip irrigation for fruits like anar.",
          "Challenges": "Rain is not guaranteed, so drought is common. Borewells go dry in summer. If rain comes late, sowing is delayed. Sometimes market rate for pomegranate and cotton is low, so income is affected."
